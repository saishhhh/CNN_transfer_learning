CNN Transfer Learning
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use transfer learning with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.

Files
cnn_transfer_learning_.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, transfer learning, training, and evaluation.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
You can install the required packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/CNN_Transfer_Learning.git
Navigate to the directory:
bash
Copy code
cd CNN_Transfer_Learning
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook cnn_transfer_learning_.ipynb
Run all cells to perform transfer learning, train, and evaluate the CNN model.
Model
The notebook uses a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) and fine-tunes it on a new dataset. The model includes:

Convolutional layers
Max Pooling layers
Fully Connected (Dense) layers
Results
The notebook includes the training process and evaluation metrics, such as accuracy and loss plots, as well as final model performance on the test set.
